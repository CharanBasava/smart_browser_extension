# Smart Browser Alert

Smart Browser Alert is a **cross-device alert system** designed as both a **Chrome extension** and a **responsive web app**. It helps users set timed alerts that display fullscreen modal reminders on their current browsing tab or mobile browser, ensuring they never miss important meetings or events.

## Project Overview

The **Smart Browser Alert** project provides users with an intuitive interface to create, manage, and receive custom alerts. Alerts trigger a fullscreen overlay on desktop browsers via a Chrome extension or directly in mobile browsers through the web app, combining modern design aesthetics inspired by [21st.dev](https://21st.dev) with accessibility and ease of use.

This project aims to unify alert management across laptops, desktops, and mobile devices in a single codebase, leveraging Chrome extension APIs where available and web APIs elsewhere.

### Key Objectives:
- Enable users to create alerts with labels, time selection, and repeat options (None, Daily, Weekly).
- Provide a clean, modern, and responsive UI that adapts to desktop and mobile screen sizes.
- Deliver fullscreen, attention-grabbing alert modals that users can dismiss manually or auto-dismiss.
- Store alert data persistently using `chrome.storage.sync` on desktop and `localStorage` on mobile.
- Seamlessly switch between Chrome extension features and web app fallbacks based on device and environment.
